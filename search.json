By constructing these concepts myself, I aim to solidify my own understanding while sharing these distilled insights with a broader audience.\nThis website is organized into the following sections:\n\nHome: You are here. The front panel and mission statement for this site.\nReviews: Comprehensive overviews of specific research areas or technological trends.\nPaper Notes: Deep dives and rigorous derivations from classic and influential papers.\nConcepts: A repository of essential physical principles, mathematical tools, and foundational equations.\nDiscussions: Explorations of open questions, future directions, and ongoing thoughts in the field."

    "text": "Etendue is an essential concept mentioned many times in group meetings and biomedical optics classes. I did not pay attention to it until an informative discussion with our team. Credits to Indra, Josh, and Junhao.\n\n\n\nConservation of etendue, Wikipedia\n\n\nThe root of etendue can be traced to statistical mechanics and Liouville’s theorem, which refers to incompressible volume in phase space. Here we present some intuitive understandings from optical systems.\n\nPerspective of opcial imaging system\n\nGiven a 4f system, the magnification is: \\[\n|\\mathrm{M}|=\\frac{f_2}{f_1}=\\frac{d_2}{d_1},\n\\] Therefore: \\[\n\\frac{d_1}{f_1}=\\frac{d_2}{f_2}.\n\\] The aperture diaphragm gives the NA of the system: \\[\n\\mathrm{NA} = \\frac{d_0/2}{f_1}.\n\\] Therefore, we have: \\[\n\\boxed{d_1\\cdot \\mathrm{NA}_1=d_2\\cdot \\mathrm{NA}_2}\n\\] This equation basically says that there is a trade-off between field of view (FOV) and resolution. Take the square on each side: \\[\nd_1^2\\mathrm{NA}_1^2=d_2^2\\mathrm{NA}_2^2\\implies A_1\\Omega_1=A_2\\Omega_2,\n\\] since the solid angle \\(\\Omega\\) is defined by \\(A/r^2\\), which is equal to \\(d_0^2/f^2\\) in the system.\n\n\nPerspective of information\nThe etendue \\(A\\cdot \\Omega\\) is the optical throughput received from the camera side. For small angles (paraxial approximation), we have: \\(\\mathrm{NA}\\propto \\sqrt{\\Omega}\\). Therefore, the camera sees: \\[\nN_{\\mathrm{px}}=\\frac{A}{\\Delta p^2}\\propto\\frac{A}{(\\lambda/\\mathrm{NA})^2}=\\frac{A\\Omega}{\\lambda^2}\\propto \\boxed{A\\Omega}.\n\\] The etendue is proportional to the total image pixels obtained by the camera, which is the terminal for the image system."
