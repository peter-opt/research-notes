*Etendue* is an essential concept mentioned many times in group meetings and biomedical optics classes. I did not pay attention to it until an informative discussion with our team. Credits to Indra, Josh, and Junhao.

The root of etendue can be traced to statistical mechanics and [Liouvilleâ€™s theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liouville%27s_theorem_(Hamiltonian)), which refers to incompressible volume in phase space. Here we present some intuitive understandings from optical systems.

### Perspective of opcial imaging system

Given a 4f system, the magnification is:
$$
|\mathrm{M}|=\frac{f_2}{f_1}=\frac{d_2}{d_1},
$$
Therefore:
$$
\frac{d_1}{f_1}=\frac{d_2}{f_2}.
$$
The aperture diaphragm gives the NA of the system:
$$
\mathrm{NA} = \frac{d_0/2}{f_1}.
$$
Therefore, we have:
$$
\boxed{d_1\cdot \mathrm{NA}_1=d_2\cdot \mathrm{NA}_2}
$$
This equation basically says that there is a trade-off between field of view (FOV) and resolution. Take the square on each side:
$$
d_1^2\mathrm{NA}_1^2=d_2^2\mathrm{NA}_2^2\implies A_1\Omega_1=A_2\Omega_2,
$$
since the [solid angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_angle) $\Omega$ is defined by $A/r^2$, which is equal to $d_0^2/f^2$ in the system.



### Perspective of information

The etendue $A\cdot \Omega$ is the optical throughput received from the camera side.  For small angles (paraxial approximation), we have: $\mathrm{NA}\propto \sqrt{\Omega}$. Therefore, the camera sees:
$$
N_{\mathrm{px}}=\frac{A}{\Delta p^2}\propto\frac{A}{(\lambda/\mathrm{NA})^2}=\frac{A\Omega}{\lambda^2}\propto \boxed{A\Omega}.
$$
The etendue is proportional to the total image pixels obtained by the camera, which is the terminal for the image system.
